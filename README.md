### Part2 - ICES

During the semester, I completed 8 individual coding exercises. I learned about data manipulation techniques and various educational data mining methods, including Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA, Diagnostic Metrics, and Social Network Analysis etc.

### Part 3 - ACAs

The 4 Analysis Challenge Assignments helped me practice what I have learned in class with real-world problems. In ACA1, I used data masking to access the specific data elements that are needed. In ACA2, I adopted logistic regression and decision tree to build the classifier for prediction. In ACA3, I tried PCA and Silhouette Coefficient to reduce dimension and identify clusters. In ACA4, I applied social network analysis to identify and analyze a network.

### Part 4 - Creative EDM Assignment

The final Creative EDM Assignment required us to identify our own inquiry questions and craft an analytical plan. Our question is, how can schools help their students with course selection? Then we chose to use Social Network Analysis and Clustering to provide students with more information that could help them with class selection.
