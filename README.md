### Part2 - ICES

Through this course, I have learned numerous educationa data mining and manipulation skills such as produce perdiction using Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA, Diagnostic Metrics, and Social Network Analysis.

### Part 3 - ACAs

The ACAS offered me a taste of working with real-world data. In ACA1 I employed data masking techniques to filter out the data i need. While ACA 2 got me engaged in training logistic regression with dataset and building decision tree to do perdiction and classification works. ACA 3 and 4 familiarize me with clustering, PCA, and social network analysis.

### Part 4 - Creative EDM Assignment

The final Creative EDM Assignment challenge our group with identifying inquiry problems and proposing an analytical plan comprise with our unique solution. Our question is, how can schools help their students with course selection? We opted for employing Social Network Analysis and Clustering to provide students with more information that could help them with class selection.
